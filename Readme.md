## ✨ Project Goal & Motivation

This repository serves as a commitment to continuous learning and portfolio building. The core objective is to rapidly upskill in three critical technical areas—**Python**, **SQL**, and **DevOps**—through a daily, consistent coding and version control practice.

A primary requirement of this challenge is a minimum of **one commit per day** to reinforce consistency and develop strong professional habits.

## 🎯 Technologies & Skills Covered

This project follows a structured curriculum, building difficulty sequentially from basic to advanced concepts.

| Pillar | Key Skills Focus | Learning Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python** | Fundamentals, Data Structures, OOP, Error Handling | Foundational Scripting and Automation |
| **SQL** | DDL/DML, Joins, Aggregation, Advanced Querying | Data Definition and Relational Data Management | Indexing
| **DevOps** | Git Workflow, Command Line, Environment Setup, Docker (later) | Version Control, Deployment Readiness, Automation |

## 🗓️ Challenge Structure

The content is organized into weekly modules to ensure a focused progression:

| Week | Focus Area | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1** | Python Fundamentals & CLI Basics | In Progress / Planned |
| **Week 2** | Python Data Structures & Intermediate SQL | Planned |
| **Week 3** | Data Analysis (Pandas/NumPy) & Advanced SQL | Planned |
| **Week 4** | DevOps (Git, Containers) & Integration Project | Planned |

## 💻 Daily Progress - Day [01]

This section tracks the specific tasks completed each day.

### **[Day 01 - Date: 2024-06-15]: Python Variables, SQL DDL/DML, and Git Init**

- **Python:** Successfully implemented variables (`int`, `str`, `bool`) and the `print()` function. Explored basic string manipulation (`.split()`) and iteration (`for` loop).
- **SQL:** Classified the four main SQL command types (DDL, DML, TCL, DCL) and their respective functions.
- **DevOps:** Initialized the Git repository, performed the first `git commit`, and established the remote connection (`git push`).
- **File:** `day_01_combined.py`

***

## 🔑 Key Takeaways & Professional Value

* **Consistency:** Demonstrated the ability to commit code daily, reflecting discipline and reliability.
* **Version Control:** Mastery of the essential Git workflow (`add`, `commit`, `push`, `status`) required in any professional development environment.
* **Integrated Learning:** Proven capability to switch context and integrate knowledge across Python scripting, database management, and infrastructure tools.
